## v1.0.1

    
    - Removed unlimited ammo option
    - Removed additional ammo slider
    
    These where removed because Straftat doesn't currently have a method to filter mod using players from the vanilla users in public lobbies. They might see a return in the future once better modding support is added.

## v1.0.0

    Initial Release
    - Added options to enable / disable weapons from spawning.
    - Added option for additional ammo to appear when picking up new guns (0-1000)
    - Added option for host to have unlimited ammo.
